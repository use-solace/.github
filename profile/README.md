# Solace
Solace is an AI chat platform that cares. Development begins in 2026.


## Manifesto
Solace exists because most modern AI platforms treat users as products.

Large AI corporations harvest user data, monetize it, and centralize control. They operate massive data centers that consume enormous amounts of electricity and water, often increasing local taxes and environmental strain.

Solace rejects this model.

Solace is:

- **Free**
    
- **Private**
    
- **Unfederated**
    
- **Power-efficient**
    
- **Self-hosted at a human scale**
    

Instead of water-cooled data centers, Solace runs air-cooled, power-optimized hardware in local environments. The goal is not infinite scale, but sustainable, user-respecting access to AI.

Solace prioritizes users over profit and privacy over growth.
