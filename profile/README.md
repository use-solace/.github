[Solace](https://github.com/use-solace/solace/) is the open-source private AI chat platform designed to make private AI chat accessible to the general public, whether self-hosting or not. Easily login and chat with a collection of LLMs.

## Manifesto
Solace exists because most modern AI platforms treat users as products.

Large AI corporations harvest user data, monetize it, and centralize control. They operate massive data centers that consume enormous amounts of electricity and water, often increasing local taxes and environmental strain.

Solace rejects this model.

Solace is free, private, fully open-source, unfederated, liberated, power-efficient, and self-hosted at a human scale (self-hosted on servers ran by maintainers)

Instead of water-cooled data centers, Solace runs air-cooled, power-optimized hardware in local environments. The goal is not infinite scale, but sustainable, user-respecting access to AI.

Solace prioritizes users over profit and privacy over growth.
